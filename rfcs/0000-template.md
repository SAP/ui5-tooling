# RFC 0000 Fancy Title
*Disclaimer: This template is derived from the great [RFC template](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/blob/master/0000-template.md) that Yarn has come up with. (You may remove this disclaimer).*

## Summary
One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation
Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted, the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words, enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too closely to the solution you have in mind.

## Detailed design
This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the UI5 Tooling to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

## How we teach this
What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this idea best presented?

Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the UI5 Tooling or any of its subcomponents documentation must be re-organized or altered?

How should this feature be introduced and taught to existing UI5 Tooling users?

## Drawbacks
Why should we not do this? Please consider the impact on teaching people to use the UI5 Tooling, on the integration of this feature with existing and planned features, on the impact of churn on existing users.

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives
What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved Questions and Bikeshedding
*This section should be removed (i.e. resolved) before merging*

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD? Are there any second priority decisions left to be made?
