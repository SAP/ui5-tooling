# Troubleshooting
## UI5 Server
### Chrome redirects HTTP URLs to HTTPS (`ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR`)
An HTTPS server or proxy that was previously running on a domain (e.g. `localhost`), might have set an HSTS header, enforcing Chrome to always use HTTPS for this domain. See https://www.chromium.org/hsts. This makes it impossible to connect to an HTTP-only server running on the same domain.

#### Resolution
You need to delete the HSTS mapping in [chrome://net-internals/#hsts](chrome://net-internals/#hsts) by entering the domain name (e.g. `localhost`) and pressing "delete".
