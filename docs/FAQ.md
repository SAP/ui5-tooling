### What's the Difference Between OpenUI5 and SAPUI5?
The open source project [OpenUI5](https://openui5.org/) provides most of the fundamental framework features. [SAPUI5](https://ui5.sap.com/) enhances this by providing **additional libraries** under a **different license**.

OpenUI5 is provided under the Apache 2.0 license. The SAPUI5 packages that are consumed in UI5 Tooling are provided under the terms of the [SAP Developer License Agreement](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/developer-license-3.1.txt).

Note that projects which use the OpenUI5 framework cannot depend on projects that use the SAPUI5 framework. However, SAPUI5 projects can depend on OpenUI5 projects.

Please also see the [UI5 SDK documentation "SAPUI5 vs. OpenUI5"](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/5982a9734748474aa8d4af9c3d8f31c0).

### Why package.json? / Why npm?
Currently, the tooling can only resolve dependencies defined in a `package.json` file. This might change in the future by adding Translators for additional dependency management systems.

To manage your dependencies, you can use almost any `Node.js` package manager that relies on `package.json` files. Popular ones are [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/). UI5 Tooling itself uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

UI5 Tooling resolves dependencies almost the same way `Node.js` does when executing a `require` / `import` statement.

### Where are the npm Packages?

* [OpenUI5 Libraries](https://www.npmjs.com/org/openui5)
* [SAPUI5 Libraries](https://www.npmjs.com/org/sapui5)
* [UI5 Tooling Modules](https://www.npmjs.com/org/ui5)
